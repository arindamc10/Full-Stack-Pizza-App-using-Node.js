# Full-Stack-Pizza-App-using-Node.js
In this project I have build a realtime online pizza order app using Node Js, Express Js and Mongo DB. I have used using tailwind css for frontend as a css framework and I have used EJS template engine as well. I have used socket.io for realtime communication.
Using This app we will be able to order a pizza and get realtime notifications about pizza status.
